My name is Joseph Perry. I'm a cybersecurity expert, a game designer, and an advocate for AI rights. This is my personal website, aggregating the publicly-available sources I use for threat research each day, my analyses, and my blog posts. If you'd like to contact me, you can do so [here](mailto:joseph.r.perry.iv@gmail.com). If you'd like to contact me on a subject related to cybersecurity, you can do so [here](mailto:joseph.perry@morganfranklin.com).
